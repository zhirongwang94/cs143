Since all modifications we are dealing with are deletions, RI violation will occur only when we delete from a referenced table. A and B are referenced table. Let's analyze them separately. 

Deleting from B won't cause violate since the dangling tuples in B have been dealt with by the "ON DELETE SET NULL" statement.


Table B, C, and D are all referencing to table A. Table B's reference to Table A won't cause a RI violation since it's been dealt with by the "REFERENCES A(w) ON DELETE SET NULL" statement. However. The reference from table C to table A and from table D to table A might cause RI violation since the dangling tuples in C and D are not dealt with after deleting from A. 

Thus, "DELETE FROM C" must happen before "DELETE FROM A", and "DELETE FROM D" must happen before  "DELETE FROM A". 

Thus,  II and III works, I doesn't work.
