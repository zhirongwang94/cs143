Binomial:
 used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. 

Without Replacement: --> Hypergeometric Distribution 
(If n<<N, then Binomial ~= Hypergeometric Distrbution)


Multinomial 
	Throwing two dies. 

Uniform Distribution:
	The probability of the event occurring remains the same. 

Poisson Distribution: 
	expresses the probability of a given number of event occurring in a fixed interval of time/space if these events occur with a known constantt mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.
